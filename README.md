# Welcome to Ollemur

Ollemur (pronounced "oh-[lemur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemur)") is my attempt at creating a web frontend for LLMs running via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). By default, Ollama runs various LLMs in your terminal. This app provides a simple frontend with markdown rendering so that the chat bot is easier to read and interact with.
